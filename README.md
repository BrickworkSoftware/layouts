# Layouts

In an effort to provide safe, standard, revision control around our critical client code.

For each client whos code we maintain:

* create a ```client/``` directory
* create files corresponding to each field:
  * desktop_header.html
  * desktop_footer.html
  * head_js.html
  * custom.css
  * etc
* use links to the raw view of these files for Layout source urls
  * Base URL: **https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrickworkSoftware/layouts/master**
  * Client File:  **/client-company/desktop_header.html**
